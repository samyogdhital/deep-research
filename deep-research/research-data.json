The study, funded by the European Commission, aims to reduce CO2 emissions and address the EU Green Deal's net-zero carbon objective by 2050. The study validates the technical feasibility of space data centers, estimating that they would require a launcher ten times less emissive over its entire lifecycle. Moreover, these data centers would not require water for cooling, which is advantageous in times of increasing drought. ASCEND also aims to deploy one gigawatt of data center capacity in space by 2050, with an estimated market of 23 gigawatts by 2030, and predicts a return on investment of several billion euros.",

Modular data centers in space can offer infinite expansion of computing power without location constraints. They could utilize solar panels for unlimited green energy, and asteroids could supply water for cooling. Several companies and research groups are actively exploring and developing space-based data centers. A paper in _Symmetry_ from researchers in South Africa found several asteroids with relatively close trajectories that could supply orbiting data centers with enough water to last centuries. Axiom Space is partnering with Kepler Space and Skyloom to develop the world's first functional space-based data center.",
