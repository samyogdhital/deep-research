                - The most important requirement is to ensure that the inlet air temperature to the front of the equipment does not exceed IBM® environmental specifications. See the environmental requirements in the system specifications or hardware specification sheets.

                - Heat loads should be assessed thoroughly, understanding how the equipment and application behave with regard to heat load, including considerations for future growth. 

                - Data centers built in the last 10 years typically cool up to 3KW of heat load per cabinet. [IBM®]

                - A total heat load assessment should be conducted to determine your overall environment balance point. The purpose of the assessment is to see if you have enough sensible cooling, including redundancy, to handle the heat load that you plan to install or have installed.

                - The hot-aisle, cold-aisle arrangement, as described in the ASHRAE publication "Thermal Guidelines for Data Processing Environments" (2011), should be used, with cold aisles consisting of perforated floor tiles. [https://www.ashrae.org/]

                - Ensure inlet air temperatures to the rack meet the manufacturer's specifications.

                - Two approaches for managing heat load include providing ample cooling for maximum heat load requirements across the entire data center or providing an average amount of cooling with the capability to increase cooling in local areas.

                - Perforated tiles should be placed exclusively in the cold aisles and aligned with the intakes of the equipment.

                - Openings in the raised-floor that are not there for the purpose of delivering chilled air directly to the equipment in the data center space should be completely sealed with brush assemblies or other cable opening material.

                - Flow rates as high as 700-800 cfm per tile are possible with tiles with the highest percent-open rating.

                - In areas under the raised floor where air velocities exceed about 530 feet-per-minute, a Venturi effect may be created where room air will be sucked downward into the raised floor.

                - CRAC units are placed at the end of the hot aisles to facilitate the return of the hot air to the CRAC unit and maximize static pressure to the cold aisle.

                - Option 1 (providing ample cooling for the maximum heat load) is very expensive.

                - The hot-aisle, cold-aisle arrangement is explained in the ASHRAE publication, "Thermal Guidelines for Data Processing Environments", dated 2011.

                - Altitude corrections are noted in the lower portion of the chart for high-end equipment chilled airflow and temperature requirements.
