// Step 1: This query generator(master) agent will initially get the user's initial detailed prompt and some set of followup questions along with answers to that questions. So that agent can understand the user's question with great clarity. Now this agent must understand the exact the query user is trying to understand and learn based on the information query generator agent got. Since the user will give the agent his understanding as well as the focus of the research the user wants to do in that initial query and followup questions, the agent need to recognize the user's understanding level.
// Step 2: Then the agent need to generate very precise keywords to do serp query. These keywords must be 1-7 words long. No more words beyond 7. These queries needs to be highly precise and strategic to get the most relevant information from the internet. The agent must understand and generate queries, if hit on search engine, will very very precisely answer the exact query the user is asking. Along with the query, a very detailed long objective is also generated by the query generator agent under each serp query. That means, the agent will generate serp query with very detailed and precise objective. The serp query and the objective should make sure that, if the query is hit on the search engine and say top 10 websites results coming from the search engine, if we scrape those websites, the objective of the information is 100% met. Before generating the objective and query, the agent must make sure it understands the user query precisely.
