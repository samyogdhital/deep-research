# Space-Based Data Centers: A Feasibility Study

Data centers are the backbone of the digital age, but their energy consumption and environmental impact are significant concerns. As data storage demands increase and land use becomes more limited, the idea of locating data centers in space, particularly in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), has gained traction [Projections and feasibility of data centers in space](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Projections-and-feasibility-of-data-centers-in-space).

## The ASCEND Feasibility Study

The ASCEND (Advanced Space Cloud for European Net zero emission and Data sovereignty) project, a study launched in 2023 and funded by the European Commission under the Horizon Europe program, is examining the feasibility of space-based data centers [Thales Alenia Space reveals results of ASCEND feasibility study: space data centers](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0). Coordinated by Thales Alenia Space, the study compares the environmental impacts of space-based and Earth-based data centers and validates the technological feasibility of developing, deploying, and operating such centers in orbit [The Engineer](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/).

The ASCEND study's results suggest that space-based data centers could significantly reduce CO2 emissions and eliminate the need for water-based cooling systems [The Engineer](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/). According to Christopher Valorge, CTO of Thales Alenia Space, deploying data centers in space could transform the European digital landscape, offering a more eco-friendly and sovereign solution for hosting and processing data [18-month study measures viability of space-based data centres](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/).

## Potential Benefits

Space-based data centers offer several potential advantages:

*   **Reduced Environmental Impact:** Space infrastructures would require a launcher ten times less emissive over its entire lifecycle and would not require water for cooling [Thales Alenia Space reveals results of ASCEND feasibility study: space data centers](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0).
*   **Lower Energy Costs:** Space-based data centers can leverage solar power, which is abundant and readily available in space [Data centers in space: feasible, sustainable and could drive returns](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/data-centers-space-feasible-sustainable-and-could-drive-returns).
*   **Land Conservation:** Locating data centers in LEO would save limited land space on Earth, leaving it for more efficient uses like farming or housing [Projections and feasibility of data centers in space](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Projections-and-feasibility-of-data-centers-in-space).
*   **Improved Performance:** For satellite-based workloads, space-based data centers can enable faster data transmission and reduce latency [Projections and feasibility of data centers in space](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Projections-and-feasibility-of-data-centers-in-space).

## Challenges and Considerations

Despite the potential benefits, space-based data centers face significant challenges:

*   **Extreme Environment:** Data center hardware must withstand extreme temperatures, radiation, and vacuum conditions in space [Projections and feasibility of data centers in space](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Projections-and-feasibility-of-data-centers-in-space).
*   **Cooling:** Specialized cooling systems are needed to dissipate heat in the vacuum of space [Projections and feasibility of data centers in space](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Projections-and-feasibility-of-data-centers-in-space).
*   **Launch Costs:** Transporting equipment and maintaining a data center in space is expensive, although the ASCEND study suggests a launcher with a carbon footprint only one-tenth that of current systems is feasible [hellofuture](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/).
*   **Space Debris:** The chosen orbit should have a relatively low space debris population [hellofuture](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/).
*   **Reliability:** Ensuring the reliable operation of hardware in the harsh space environment is crucial [Projections and feasibility of data centers in space](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Projections-and-feasibility-of-data-centers-in-space).

## Future Outlook

The ASCEND project aims to deploy one gigawatt of data center capacity before 2050, with an estimated market of 23 gigawatts by 2030, offering a prospect of a return on investment of several billion euros between now and 2050 [Thales Alenia Space reveals results of ASCEND feasibility study: space data centers](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0). Thales Alenia Space is targeting the deployment of 1GW of capacity by 2050 [18-month study measures viability of space-based data centres](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/). An architectural proof of concept is planned for 2031, and the initial space data center deployment by 2036 [hellofuture](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/). Europe could potentially have these data centers in orbit as soon as 2036 [18-month study measures viability of space-based data centres](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/).

Modular space infrastructure, assembled in orbit using robotics, is a central element, with the first mission of the European Robotic Orbital Support Services In Orbit Demonstrator (EROSS IOD) planned for 2026 [Data centers in space: feasible, sustainable and could drive returns](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/data-centers-space-feasible-sustainable-and-could-drive-returns).

## Conclusion

Space-based data centers represent a potentially disruptive technology with the capacity to reduce environmental impact, conserve land, and improve performance for specific workloads. While significant technological and economic hurdles remain, ongoing research and development efforts, such as the ASCEND project, are paving the way for the realization of this innovative concept. If Europe succeeds in designing a launcher that is ten times less emissive over its entire lifecycle, the first orbiting data center could be deployed by 2050 [hellofuture](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/).
