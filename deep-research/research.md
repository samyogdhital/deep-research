# Space-Based Data Centers: A Technical Feasibility Report

## Introduction

This report assesses the technical and economic feasibility of deploying data centers in space. Recent studies indicate that space-based data centers could offer several advantages, including reduced carbon emissions, lower energy costs, and improved data latency [1](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0). The increasing demand for data processing, particularly driven by generative AI workloads, necessitates exploring innovative solutions like space-based infrastructure [1](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0).

## Feasibility Studies and Economic Viability

The ASCEND (Advanced Space Cloud for European Net zero emission and Data sovereignty) feasibility study, funded by the European Commission, has shown promising results regarding the viability of space-based data centers [4](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/). The study indicates that these data centers are economically feasible and could significantly reduce CO2 emissions [1](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0). Thales Alenia Space, the coordinator of the study, projects a return on investment of several billion euros between now and 2050 [1](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0).

The study estimates a market of 23GW by 2030, aiming to deploy 1GW of data center capacity in space by 2050 [1](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0). This infrastructure would leverage modular space designs assembled in orbit using robotic systems [1](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0).

## Technical Advantages

Space-based data centers offer several technical advantages over their terrestrial counterparts. One primary benefit is the potential for reduced energy costs, as solar power can be harnessed efficiently in space [5](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Projections-and-feasibility-of-data-centers-in-space). The natural cooling properties of space eliminate the need for water-based cooling systems, further reducing operational costs and environmental impact [1](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0), [3](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/space-the-final-data-center-frontier/). Moreover, the strategic placement of data centers in space can decrease data latency by serving as relay points for intercontinental data transfer [6](https://www.universetoday.com/167477/could-we-put-data-centers-in-space/).

Another significant advantage is the elimination of land use constraints [5](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Projections-and-feasibility-of-data-centers-in-space). Traditional data centers require substantial land areas, which can be a limiting factor, especially in densely populated regions.

## Technical Challenges

Despite the potential benefits, several technical challenges need to be addressed. One major hurdle is the high cost of launching equipment and infrastructure into space. Reducing the emissions and cost of launchers will be crucial for the economic viability of space-based data centers, with the ASCEND study indicating that space infrastructures would require a launcher ten times less emissive over its lifecycle [1](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0).

Data transfer rates and bandwidth limitations also pose challenges [6](https://www.universetoday.com/167477/could-we-put-data-centers-in-space/). Ensuring reliable and high-speed communication between space-based data centers and terrestrial networks is essential. The effects of radiation on electronic components and data storage systems must also be mitigated through robust shielding and error correction mechanisms [6](https://www.universetoday.com/167477/could-we-put-data-centers-in-space/).

## Current Initiatives

Several companies and organizations are actively exploring space-based data center technologies. Axiom Space and Skyloom are developing orbital data centers [1](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0), [2](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/data-centers-space-feasible-sustainable-and-could-drive-returns). Other initiatives focus on power and cooling solutions, including the potential use of green energy sources and water extracted from asteroids for cooling purposes [6](https://www.universetoday.com/167477/could-we-put-data-centers-in-space/).

## Conclusion

Space-based data centers represent a promising frontier for addressing the growing demand for data processing and storage. While technical and economic challenges remain, ongoing research and development efforts are paving the way for feasible and sustainable space-based infrastructure. The potential benefits, including reduced carbon emissions, lower energy costs, and improved data latency, make space-based data centers a compelling area for future investment and innovation [7](https://ascend-horizon.eu/data-centres-in-space/).
