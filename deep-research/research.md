# Addressing Truncation Issues with Minimal Code Change

This research paper addresses the issue of data truncation in various contexts, providing potential solutions with minimal code modifications. Truncation, in general, refers to the shortening of data, whether it's a string, numerical value, or a code segment. The causes and solutions vary based on the specific environment where truncation occurs.

## 1. Understanding Truncation Errors

Truncation errors arise in several scenarios, including numerical analysis, database operations, and data transfer processes. In numerical analysis, truncation error is caused by approximating mathematical processes, often involving the truncation of an infinite series to make computation practical [Truncation error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_error). In the context of code generation by Large Language Models (LLMs), code truncation can occur due to function overflow, where redundant or incomplete code is generated [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.00676v1).

### 1.1. Numerical Integration

In numerical integration, truncation errors are categorized into local and global errors. The local truncation error represents the error caused by a single iteration, while the global truncation error accumulates local errors over multiple iterations [Truncation error (numerical integration)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_error_(numerical_integration)).

### 1.2. Database Context

In databases, truncation errors often occur when data being inserted or updated exceeds the defined column size [String or binary data would be truncated in SQL](https://foxlearn.com/sql/how-to-fix-string-or-binary-data-would-be-truncated-in-sql-1787.html). This can also happen due to data type mismatches or incorrect collation settings [unexpected truncation error when inserting from ut](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1693889/unexpected-truncation-error-when-inserting-from-ut).

### 1.3. LLM Context

In LLMs such as ChatGPT, truncation occurs when the output token limit is reached [coding issues with python truncation of generated code](https://community.openai.com/t/coding-issues-with-python-truncation-of-generated-code/792700).  This can result in incomplete code generation.

## 2. Minimal Code Change Solutions

Several strategies can be employed to mitigate truncation issues with minimal code changes, depending on the specific context.

### 2.1. Adjusting Data Size

One approach is to adjust the data size to fit column constraints.  This involves truncating data within the application before insertion to match column size limits [fixing-mysqldatatruncation-data-too-long-for-column-error](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/fixing-mysqldatatruncation-data-too-long-for-column-error.html). For instance, in Java:

```java
if (firstname.length() > maxColumnSize) {
 firstname = firstname.substring(0, maxColumnSize);
}
```

Input validation can also ensure that data length does not exceed the column size.

### 2.2. Database Configuration Adjustments

In some cases, database configurations can be modified to allow truncation.  For IBM i Access Client Solutions, the `AcsConfig.properties` file can be modified to enable character truncation by setting `com.ibm.iaccess.dataxfer.jdbc.AllowCharacterTruncation=true` [data-truncation-access-client-solutions-data-transfer](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/data-truncation-access-client-solutions-data-transfer).

### 2.3. SQL Server Specific Solutions

For SQL Server, if the truncation is due to incorrect size calculations between UTF-8 and other collations, the `COLLATE` clause can be used during insertion to force conversion before length calculation [unexpected truncation error when inserting from ut](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1693889/unexpected-truncation-error-when-inserting-from-ut).

### 2.4. Using `TRUNCATE TABLE` Statement

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement in SQL can be used to quickly remove all data from a table, which can be useful in certain data management scenarios [truncate in sql](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/sql-tutorial/truncate-in-sql).  However, this is a DDL operation and bypasses integrity checking mechanisms, so it must be used cautiously [truncate-table-transact-sql](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/truncate-table-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16).

### 2.5. Prompt Engineering for LLMs

To prevent code truncation with LLMs, include explicit constraints in your prompts, such as
