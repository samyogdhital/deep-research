## Introduction

The exponential growth of data generation and processing, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, and cloud computing, has placed immense strain on existing terrestrial data center infrastructure [Data centers in space are economically feasible and could reduce carbon emissions as workloads for generative AI surge, according to Thales Alenia Space, the coordinator of a European Commission study.](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/data-centers-space-feasible-sustainable-and-could-drive-returns). Traditional data centers consume vast amounts of energy and water, contributing significantly to carbon emissions and environmental degradation. Space-based data centers offer a potentially disruptive alternative by leveraging the unique environment of space to overcome these limitations [The idea of placing data centers in space may sound like science fiction, but it’s a concept that’s being seriously considered by some in the tech and aerospace industries. The basic premise involves launching specially designed data center modules into orbit around Earth, where they would operate in the unique environment of space.](https://newspaceeconomy.ca/2024/06/24/the-potential-and-challenges-of-space-based-data-centers/).
