# Space-Based Data Center Technical Report

Space-based data centers are an emerging concept that could revolutionize data processing and storage by leveraging the unique advantages of the space environment [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html). These advantages include access to abundant solar energy, reduced latency in global data transmission, and the potential for efficient heat dissipation [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html). Several companies and organizations are actively pursuing the development and deployment of such data centers [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).

## Current Initiatives and Technologies

Several organizations have already started to explore space-based data centers. Lumen Orbit, for example, has raised $2.4 million to develop space-based data centers, aiming to leverage high-intensity solar power to reduce energy costs for AI model training by up to 95% [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html). Their plan involves the creation of massive solar arrays in space to feed energy into high-density compute modules, utilizing advanced cooling systems like liquid cooling or two-phase immersion cooling to manage the heat generated by powerful AI workloads [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).

Axiom Space is partnering with Kepler Space and Skyloom to develop a functional space-based data center [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html). They are developing an orbital data center capability (ODC T1) for their commercial space station, which will utilize optical intersatellite links (OISLs) for secure data transmission and feature a modular design to accommodate growing needs [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html). These orbital data centers use a laser-based communication system called optical intersatellite links (OISLs) to securely transmit data to other satellites [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).

Thales Alenia Space is working on a 50-kilowatt proof of concept for a space data center to be deployed by 2031, with plans to scale up to 1-gigawatt by 2050, potentially generating billions of Euros [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html). IBM researchers, in partnership with KP Labs, are studying orbital data centers for the European Space Agency (ESA), proposing scenarios including data processing satellites and a lunar lander acting as a data center [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).

## Key Components and Technologies

Several key technological components are essential for the realization of space-based data centers:

*   **Power Generation:** High-intensity solar power is a primary energy source, requiring the deployment of large solar arrays [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).
*   **Cooling Systems:** Advanced cooling systems, such as liquid cooling or two-phase immersion cooling, are necessary to manage the heat generated by high-density compute modules [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).
*   **Data Transmission:** Optical intersatellite links (OISLs) are crucial for secure and high-speed data transmission between satellites and ground stations [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).
*   **Radiation Shielding:** Robust radiation shielding is needed to protect electronic components from the harsh space environment [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).
*   **Thermal Management:** Effective thermal management systems are required to maintain optimal operating temperatures for the data center components [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).

## Existing Space-Based Computing Infrastructure

While fully functional space-based data centers are still under development, some computing infrastructure already exists in space. HPE sent the Spaceborne Computer-2 to the International Space Station (ISS) in February 2021 [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html). This system includes HPE Edgeline Converged EL4000 Edge and HPE ProLiant machines with an Nvidia T4 GPU to support AI workloads [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html). Additionally, the European Space Agency launched PhiSat-1, the first satellite with AI processing on board, using Intel's Movidius Myriad 2 chip [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the potential benefits, space-based data centers face several challenges, including the high cost of launch and deployment, the need for reliable and efficient cooling systems in a vacuum environment, and the challenges of maintaining and repairing equipment in space [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html). Future research and development efforts will need to address these challenges to make space-based data centers a viable option for high-performance computing and data storage [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).

Lumen Orbit plans a satellite demonstration in 2025 as part of the NVIDIA Inception startup incubator program [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html). NTT, in partnership with Japanâ€™s SKY Perfect JSAT Holdings, plans to launch satellites with computing and storage capabilities by 2025, forming a single data center via optical links [1](https://phys.org/news/2024-06-centers-space.html).
