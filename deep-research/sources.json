No matter how fast computers and software generate trades, any network transmitting data introduces latency due to the fiber-optic media over which it travels. It is the law of physics that light propagation on a fiber-optic network introduces a constant latency of approximately five microseconds per kilometer (0.6 mi). While science cannot be changed, there are techniques in optical network design and component selection that can minimize latency through other portions of the optical network."
