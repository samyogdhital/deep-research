      "report": "# Technical Report: Space-Based Data Centers\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe increasing demands of AI, cloud computing, and IoT have led to a surge in the need for data centers, prompting exploration of alternative solutions beyond traditional terrestrial facilities [7](https://www.theconversation.com/data-centres-in-space-theyre-a-brilliant-idea-but-a-herculean-challenge-246635). Space-based data centers present a novel approach, offering potential advantages such as continuous solar energy access and natural cooling [7](https://www.theconversation.com/data-centres-in-space-theyre-a-brilliant-idea-but-a-herculean-challenge-246635). This report examines the feasibility, benefits, and challenges associated with deploying data centers in space, drawing on recent studies and projects.\n\n## Feasibility Studies and Initiatives\n\nThe ASCEND (Advanced Space Cloud for European Net zero emission and Data sovereignty) feasibility study, launched in 2023 and funded by the European Commission under the Horizon Europe program, has been instrumental in assessing the viability of space-based data centers [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/). This study aligns with the EU Green Deal's net-zero carbon objective by 2050, aiming to transform the European space and digital ecosystem [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/). The study compared the environmental impacts of space-based and Earth-based data centers, validating the technological feasibility of developing, deploying, and operating such centers in orbit [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/), [2](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0). Thales Alenia Space and Leonardo conducted the 18-month ASCEND study [3](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/).\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\nA key finding of the ASCEND study is the potential for space-based data centers to significantly reduce CO2 emissions and eliminate the need for water-based cooling systems [2](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0), [3](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/). Terrestrial data centers' operation accounts for 80% of their CO2 emissions [6](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/). Space infrastructures would require the development of a launcher ten times less emissive over its entire lifecycle to significantly reduce CO2 emissions [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/). The natural vacuum of space provides a cooling environment, obviating the need for water-intensive cooling systems used in terrestrial facilities [7](https://www.theconversation.com/data-centres-in-space-theyre-a-brilliant-idea-but-a-herculean-challenge-246635).\n\n## Technological Considerations\n\nThe ASCEND study validated the feasibility of a launcher capable of conducting multiple launches while mitigating their carbon footprint [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/). Modular space infrastructures would be assembled in orbit using robotic technologies from the European Commission’s EROSS IOD (European Robotic Orbital Support Services In Orbit Demonstrator), scheduled to fly its first mission in 2026 [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/), [5](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/data-centers-space-feasible-sustainable-and-could-drive-returns). The project targets an orbit at 1400 km altitude with a modular architecture and optical communication terminals to mitigate space debris and ensure robust communication [6](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/).\n\n## Economic Viability\n\nThe market for data centers by 2030 is estimated at 23GW of capacity; ASCEND aims to deploy 1GW before 2050 [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/), [2](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0). The project offers a prospect of a return on investment of several billion euros between now and 2050 [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/), [2](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0), [5](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/data-centers-space-feasible-sustainable-and-could-drive-returns). Returns on investment would justify building a high-capacity, environmentally friendly reusable launcher [5](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/data-centers-space-feasible-sustainable-and-could-drive-returns).\n\n## Challenges and Future Directions\n\nDespite the promising findings, significant challenges remain, including the high cost of space launches, communication latency, space weather, and the complexities of maintenance and waste disposal [7](https://www.theconversation.com/data-centres-in-space-theyre-a-brilliant-idea-but-a-herculean-challenge-246635). Further studies are planned to address challenges like environmentally-friendly launchers and space debris [3](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/). If these studies support the initial findings, Europe could have data centers in orbit as soon as 2036 [3](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/), [6](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/). The project aims for deployment in 2030 and will require European supply chain support, space access, orbital servicers, in-orbit assembly and manufacturing [5](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/data-centers-space-feasible-sustainable-and-could-drive-returns). Ascend has plans for demonstration programs and a proof of concept by 2031 [6](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSpace-based data centers offer a compelling vision for the future, promising reduced environmental impact and enhanced data sovereignty [2](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0), [3](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/). The ASCEND study and related initiatives have demonstrated the technological and economic feasibility of this concept. Overcoming the remaining challenges will require continued innovation and investment in areas such as environmentally friendly launchers, in-orbit assembly, and space debris mitigation. The realization of space-based data centers could transform the European digital landscape and contribute to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\n## References\n\n1.

      "report": "# Technical Report: Space-Based Data Centers\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis report examines the feasibility, benefits, and challenges of establishing data centers in space. The exponential growth of data driven by AI, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things is driving the demand for more data centers [7](https://theconversation.com/data-centres-in-space-theyre-a-brilliant-idea-but-a-herculean-challenge-246635). Space-based data centers offer potential advantages in terms of energy efficiency and environmental impact, but also present significant technological and logistical hurdles [5](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/data-centers-space-feasible-sustainable-and-could-drive-returns).\n\n## Feasibility Studies and Initiatives\n\nThe ASCEND (Advanced Space Cloud for European Net zero emission and Data sovereignty) project, funded by the European Commission and coordinated by Thales Alenia Space, is a key initiative investigating the viability of space-based data centers [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/). This feasibility study, launched in 2023, aims to compare the environmental impacts of space-based and Earth-based data centers, and validate the technological feasibility of developing, deploying, and operating such centers in orbit [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/). The study includes partners from various fields such as environmental aspects, cloud computing, launchers, and orbital systems [2](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0).\n\n## Potential Benefits\n\nSpace-based data centers offer several potential advantages over their terrestrial counterparts. One significant benefit is the potential reduction in CO2 emissions [3](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/). The operational phase of terrestrial data centers accounts for approximately 80% of their CO2 emissions [6](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/). Furthermore, space-based data centers would not require water for cooling, addressing a significant environmental concern associated with traditional data centers [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/), [2](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0).\n\nSpace offers continuous solar energy access and natural cooling via the vacuum of space [7](https://theconversation.com/data-centres-in-space-theyre-a-brilliant-idea-but-a-herculean-challenge-246635). This eliminates the reliance on terrestrial power grids and reduces the energy consumption associated with cooling systems [7](https://theconversation.com/data-centres-in-space-theyre-a-brilliant-idea-but-a-herculean-challenge-246635).\n\n## Technological Challenges\n\nDespite the potential benefits, space-based data centers face significant technological challenges. The development of a low-emission launcher is crucial [2](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0), [5](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/data-centers-space-feasible-sustainable-and-could-drive-returns). The ASCEND study emphasizes the need for a launcher that is ten times less emissive over its lifecycle [6](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/).\n\nIn-orbit assembly is another critical challenge [5](https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/insights/data-centers-space-feasible-sustainable-and-could-drive-returns). Modular space infrastructures would be assembled in orbit using robotic technologies [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/). The European Commission’s EROSS IOD (European Robotic Orbital Support Services In-Orbit Demonstrator) project, scheduled for its first mission in 2026, aims to develop these robotic capabilities [1](https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/news/feasibility-study-on-space-based-data-centres-shows-promising-results/).\n\nOther challenges include high launch costs, latency in communication, space weather, and maintenance difficulties [7](https://theconversation.com/data-centres-in-space-theyre-a-brilliant-idea-but-a-herculean-challenge-246635).\n\n## Economic Viability and Timeline\n\nThe ASCEND project aims to deploy 1GW of data center capacity in space by 2050, with a projected return on investment of several billion euros [2](https://www.thalesaleniaspace.com/en/press-releases/thales-alenia-space-reveals-results-ascend-feasibility-study-space-data-centers-0), [3](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/). Thales Alenia Space is targeting the deployment of 1GW of capacity by 2050, based on the economic viability of the project [3](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/).\n\nThe project timeline includes further studies in 2024-2025, demonstration programs for key technologies, and the deployment of an architectural proof of concept in 2031, followed by the construction and deployment of the first space data center by 2036 [6](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/). Europe could have these data centers in orbit as soon as 2036 if further studies support the initial findings [3](https://www.techerati.com/news-hub/18-month-study-measures-viability-of-space-based-data-centres/).\n\n## Orbital Parameters and Communication\n\nThe project's orbit at 1400 km altitude is chosen for its relatively low space debris population [6](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/). The data centers will employ a modular architecture with optical communication terminals and inter-satellite laser links, along with RF and optical terminals for space-ground transmissions [6](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/).\n\n## Reusable Launchers\n\nThe Protein study, conducted for ESA, is investigating the feasibility of a reusable launcher capable of deploying large-scale in-space infrastructure, with a capacity to transport 35 tonnes to an altitude of 1,400 km and reusable up to 50 times [6](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/lower-emissions-and-reinforced-digital-sovereignty-the-plan-for-datacentres-in-space/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSpace-based data centers represent a promising but challenging frontier in data infrastructure. While offering potential benefits in terms of reduced environmental impact and energy efficiency, significant technological and logistical hurdles remain. Ongoing research and development efforts, such as the ASCEND project, are crucial for realizing the vision of sustainable and scalable data centers in space [4](https://ascend-horizon.eu/data-centres-in-space/).\n\n## References\n\n1.
