## 1. Introduction

The exponential growth of AI, machine learning, and robotics necessitates computational resources beyond the capabilities of existing terrestrial datacenters. Limitations in power availability, cooling capacity, and physical space on Earth make space a compelling alternative. This report details the architecture, deployment strategy, and key technologies required to construct a multi-gigawatt space-based datacenter optimized for low-latency, high-bandwidth distributed AI training. This investigation is conducted under constraints including launch cost, the absence of space labor for now, radiation exposure, and orbital debris. The long-term goal is a datacenter operational for at least 15 years.

## 2. Architectural Design: Spine Architecture and Modularity

The proposed datacenter architecture centers around a "spine" structure. This spine serves as a central backbone for power distribution, networking, and cooling fluid circulation. Individual compute containers, housing racks of GPUs (like H100 and GB200 NVL72), attach to the spine in a modular fashion.
